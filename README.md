## Project Full Description: 

### User Registration and Login System:
- Implement a user registration form with fields for username, email, password, role.
- Set up a login system to authenticate users using their credentials.

### User Role-Based Authorization System:
- Define different user roles such as **organization admin**, **branch admin**, **team admin**, **member**, etc.
- Assign appropriate permissions to each role based on their responsibilities and access levels.

### Notice Creation:
- Allow organization admins, branch admins, and team admins to create notices.
- Design a notice creation form with fields for title, content, attachments, etc.
- Validate the notice details and store them in a database.

### Notice Approval Process:
- For notices created by members, implement an approval process.
- Designate admins who will review and approve member-created notices.
- Admins can either approve or reject notices based on their content and relevance.

### Attachment of Files:
- Restrict the attachment feature to admins only.
- Admins can upload files and attach them to notices.
- Consider implementing appropriate file size limits and file type restrictions.

### Notice Distribution to Members:
- Develop a mechanism to distribute notices to relevant members.
- Organization-level notices are visible to all members of the organization.
- Branch-level notices are visible to members belonging to that branch, and team-level notices are visible to members belonging to that team.
- Subscribers receive notices based on their subscribed levels or categories.

### Notice Management by Members:
- Allow members to view new and old notices relevant to their level and subscriptions.
- Members can mark notices as favorites for quick access.
- Enable members to edit and delete their own notices.

### Notice Approval and Visibility by Admins:
- Admins can view all notices, including pending, approved, and rejected notices.
- Admins have the ability to approve or delete notices.
- Approved notices are visible to relevant members based on their levels and subscriptions.

### Subscription Management:
- Allow members to subscribe to specific levels or categories of notices.
- Provide an interface for members to manage their subscriptions, such as adding or removing levels or categories.

### Admin-Level Actions:
- Upper-level admins can select lower-level admins and remove members from the organization or branches.
- Organization admins can view and manage branches, including creating new branches.
- Branch admins can view and manage teams, including creating new teams.
